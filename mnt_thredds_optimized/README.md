This directory is meant to mirror the data directory as closely as possible.  Eventually this will either go away or we will use it to deploy data changes.

Scripts that create these ncmls have been moved into directories relative to the ncmls them selves. These were used in a manual workflow to generate ncmls. There is NO guarantee that these scripts can be used to recreate these ncml files. Some manual intervention (find and replace, etc.) may have occurred.
