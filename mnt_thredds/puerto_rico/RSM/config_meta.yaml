summary: >- 
  The Japanese Meteorological Agency Non-Hydrostatic Model (NHM)  is nested 
  inside the Regional Spectral Model (RSM) at 10 km grid resolution which in 
  turn is forced at the lateral boundaries to dynamically downscale two general 
  circulation models (GCMs) that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison 
  Project (CMIP5). The downscaled regional climate change projections were developed 
  for two twenty-year timeslices for the high Greenhouse Gas Emission Scenario, 
  RCP8.5. These climate change projections were developed to provide information 
  about climate change for various climate change applications within Puerto Rico 
  and the US Virgin Islands. In particular, the model output parameters were saved 
  in response to the needs of physical scientists and other stakeholders within the 
  islands, including ecologists, biologists, and hydrologists. The simulations are 
  nested one-way from the GCMs with a 138.75-10-2km nest, see figure at
