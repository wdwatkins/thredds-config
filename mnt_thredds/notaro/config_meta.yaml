summary: >- 
  Six global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase Five (CMIP5) were
  dynamically downscaled to 25-km grid spacing according to the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) 
  scenario using the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) Regional Climate Model Version Four (RegCM4), 
  interactively coupled to a 1D lake model to represent the Great Lakes. These GCMs include the Centre National de Recherches 
  Meteorologiques Coupled Global Climate Model Version Five (CNRM-CM5), 
  the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate Version Five (MIROC5), the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace Coupled Model 
  Version Five-Medium Resolution (IPSL-CM5-MR), the Meteorological Research Institute Coupled Global Climate Model Version 
  Three (MRI-CGCM3), the Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research, Australia GCM (ACCESS1-0), and the National 
  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model (GFDL-ESM2M).
  
  The complete downscaling dataset is roughly 30 TB in size, stored on University of Wisconsin-Madison servers.  
  Here, we extracted a sub-region over the Northeast Climate Science Center domain for select surface variables alone.
  Only 20-year time chunks for 1980-1999, 2040-2059, and 2080-2099 are provided here.
  Contact Michael Notaro if you wish to access additional variables and/or regions.
